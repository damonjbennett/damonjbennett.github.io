The 5’9” Northern Irishman can swing his driver like very few, and his average driving distance of 320 yards in 2024 was second-best on the PGA Tour.\nHowever, driving distance is far from a success indicator on the PGA Tour. Cameron Champ, who boasted the longest average drive of 322 yards, played three events and finished inside the top-25 only once.\nMcilroy combines driving distance with striking accuracy, and as of May 4, he ranks first in strokes gained off the tee, and total strokes gained, statistics that measure how a specific part of a hole (tee shot, approach, putting) impacts a player’s score.\nFrom 2015 to 2024, 16 players on the PGA Tour gained strokes off the tee in at least 8 seasons. Only three of those players ever beat McIlroy at the tee box: Luke List and Gary Woodland in 2018, and Jhonattan Vegas in 2020.\n\n\nCode\nsgtee20 &lt;- sgteeall |&gt; \n  filter(AVG &gt;= 0)\n  \ngolfer &lt;- sgtee20 |&gt; \n  group_by(PLAYER) |&gt; \n  tally() |&gt; \n  filter(n&gt;8)\n\ngolfline &lt;- sgtee20 |&gt; \n  filter(PLAYER %in% golfer$PLAYER)\n\nroryline &lt;- golfline |&gt; \n  filter(PLAYER == \"Rory McIlroy\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_line(data=golfline, aes(x=Year, y=AVG, group=PLAYER), color = \"darkgrey\", size=1.1)+\n  geom_line(data=roryline, aes(x=Year, y=AVG, group=PLAYER), color=\"#006747\", size=1.1)+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.03482464, size=1.3)+\n  geom_text(aes(x=2022, y=.9, label=\"Rory McIlroy\"))+\n  geom_text(aes(x=2016, y=0, label=\"PGA Tour Average\"))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021,2022,2023, 2024))+\n  labs(x=\" \",\n       y=\"Average Strokes Gained Off Tee\",\n       title= \"Where McIlroy thrives\",\n       subtitle= \"Rory McIlroy gains the most strokes from his drives of anybody on Tour, helping his dominant performance.\",\n       caption=\"Source: PGATour.com | By Damon Bennett\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRory McIlroy is one of the best golfers of all time. He proved this not only by joining one of the most exclusive clubs in the world as a career Grand Slam winner, but by spending 10 years proving that playing at the highest level does not always translate to winning at the biggest stage.\nSo next time your friends ask why your 8 handicap suddenly becomes 20 when they’re around, show them this."

Binnington recorded four more shutouts and led the league in wins, saves percentage and goals-against average after his debut.\n\n\nCode\nfirsthalf &lt;- read_csv(\"NHL2019Jan2.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season = 2019.1, goaldif = GF-GA)\nsecondhalf &lt;- read_csv(\"NHL2019April7.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season = 2019.2, goaldif = GF-GA)\n\ncombined &lt;- bind_rows(firsthalf, secondhalf)\n\nstl &lt;- combined |&gt; filter(Team ==\"St. Louis Blues\")\n\ndifferential &lt;- ggplot()+\n  geom_line(data=combined, aes(x=season, y=goaldif, group=Team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_line(data=stl, aes(x=season, y=goaldif, group=Team,), color=\"#002F87\")+\n  geom_point(data=combined, aes(x=season, y=goaldif, group=Team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=stl, aes(x=season, y=goaldif, group=Team), color=\"#002F87\")+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)+\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.27, y=-7, label=\"Negative\\nGoal Diff.\"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.05, y=7, label=\"Positive\\nGoal Diff.\"), color=\"darkgreen\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.1, y=-52, label=\"Jan. 2\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.2, y=-52, label=\"April 7\"), color=\"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2019.1, 2019.2), limits=c(2019,2019.3))+\n  geom_text(data=stl |&gt; filter(season == max(season)), aes(x=season + .05, y=goaldif+.05, group=Team, label=\"St. Louis\"))+\n  geom_text(data=stl |&gt; filter(season == min(season)), aes(x=season - .05, y=goaldif, group=Team, label=\"St. Louis\"))+\n  labs(\n    x=\" \",\n    y=\"Goal Differential\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title=element_text(size=20, face=\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position=\"plot\",\n    axis.text.x=element_blank(),\n    ) \n\naverage &lt;- ggplot()+\n  geom_line(data=combined, aes(x=season, y=`GA/GP`, group=Team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_line(data=stl, aes(x=season, y=`GA/GP`, group=Team,), color=\"#002F87\")+\n  geom_point(data=combined, aes(x=season, y=`GA/GP`, group=Team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=stl, aes(x=season, y=`GA/GP`, group=Team), color=\"#002F87\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=2.81)+\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.05, y=2.9, label=\"NHL Average\"), color=\"black\")+\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.1, y=1.91, label=\"Jan. 2\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.2, y=1.91, label=\"April 7\"), color=\"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2019.1, 2019.2), limits=c(2019,2019.3))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(2,3,4), limits=c(1.9,4.1))+\n  geom_text(data=stl |&gt; filter(season == max(season)), aes(x=season + .05, y=`GA/GP`+.05, group=Team, label=\"St. Louis\"))+\n  geom_text(data=stl |&gt; filter(season == min(season)), aes(x=season - .05, y=`GA/GP`, group=Team, label=\"St. Louis\"))+\n  labs(\n    x=\" \",\n    y=\"Goals Against Average\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title=element_text(size=20, face=\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position=\"plot\",\n    axis.text.x=element_blank()\n    ) \n\ndifferential + average +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title=\"A complete 180\",\n    subtitle=\"St. Louis not only increased goals per game, but also decreased goals-against per game after Jan. 2, 2019.\",\n    caption=\"Source: NHLStats.com | By Damon Bennett\"\n  )&\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title=element_text(size=20, face=\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position=\"plot\",\n    axis.text.x=element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a shock to nobody, scoring more goals and allowing opponents to score less goals translates to wins.

In the playoffs, they never played less than six games in a series, and the fireworks continued in the final.\nOn June 12, 2019, St. Louis hoisted the Stanley Cup for the first time ever, after defeating the Boston Bruins 4-1 in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final, becoming the first team in the expansion era (since 1967, the year St. Louis joined the NHL) to win the Stanley Cup after being in last place more than 20 games into the season.\nThat stat sounds weird because it is. Two teams have won the Stanley Cup with losing records, but that was before color TV, and when the NHL was only six teams.\nLate season revivals have happened before in the NHL. The most recent example is the Los Angeles Kings in 2012, who were the 8th overall seed in the Western Conference, and defeated the New York Rangers to claim the cup. The Kings were never in last place in the league, however, and any other dramatic turnaround occurred when hockey sticks were wooden and vital organ protection was optional.\nThe NHL began playing 82 games per season in 1996. When comparing St. Louis to the other 28 champions since, it’s pretty clear just how dismal their first 37 games were.\n\n\nCode\nrankings96oct &lt;- read_csv(\"96 first half.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(season = 1996.1)|&gt;

Should teams look to repeat this combination to replicate their success? Probably not."
