    "section": "",
    "text": "On January 2, 2019, the St. Louis Blues sat alone at the bottom of the NHL. They held the worst record in the league with 15 wins, 18 losses, and four overtime losses, their head coach had been fired in November, and a fist fight broke out at practice on December 10.\nThings were not looking good in St. Louis.\nThen, on January 7, Jordan Binnington made his debut as starting goaltender. In his first game after being called up from the AHL, he became the 35th rookie in league history to post a shutout in their first career start in a 3-0 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)\ngoalies &lt;- read_csv(\"NHL 2018-19 Goalie Stats.csv\") |&gt; \n  filter(GP&gt;=20) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(`SV%`))\n\ngoalies |&gt; \n  select(Player, Tm, GP, GS, W, L, `T/O`, `SV%`) |&gt; \n  filter(`SV%` &gt;=0.922) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Tm=\"Team\",\n    GP=\"Games Played\",\n    GS=\"Games Started\",\n    W=\"Wins\",\n    L=\"Losses\",\n    `T/O`=\"Overtime Losses\",\n    `SV%`=\"Save Percentage\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title=\"Jordan Binnington: Rookie Sensation\",\n    subtitle=\"As a rookie, Jordan Binnington had one of the highest Save Percentages in 2019. \"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")) |&gt; \n      tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\") ) |&gt; \n   tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Damon Bennett  |  **Source:** NHL.com\")) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   )  |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#002F87\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#FCB514\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Jordan Binnington\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Binnington: Rookie Sensation\n\n\nAs a rookie, Jordan Binnington had one of the highest Save Percentages in 2019.\n\n\nPlayer\nTeam\nGames Played\nGames Started\nWins\nLosses\nOvertime Losses\nSave Percentage\n\n\n\n\nBen Bishop\nDAL\n46\n45\n27\n15\n2\n0.934\n\n\nRobin Lehner\nNYI\n46\n43\n25\n13\n5\n0.930\n\n\nJack Campbell\nLAK\n31\n25\n10\n14\n1\n0.928\n\n\nJordan Binnington\nSTL\n32\n30\n24\n5\n1\n0.927\n\n\nThomas Greiss\nNYI\n43\n39\n23\n14\n2\n0.927\n\n\nLaurent Brossoit\nWPG\n21\n19\n13\n6\n2\n0.925\n\n\nDarcy Kuemper\nARI\n55\n55\n27\n20\n8\n0.925\n\n\nAndrei Vasilevskiy\nTBL\n53\n53\n39\n10\n4\n0.925\n\n\nAnton Khudobin\nDAL\n41\n37\n16\n17\n5\n0.923\n\n\nJaroslav Halák\nBOS\n40\n37\n22\n11\n4\n0.922\n\n\n\nBy: Damon Bennett | Source: NHL.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, things turned around for St. Louis. From January 23 to February 19, the Blues won a franchise-record 11 games in a row.\nIn their first 37 games, the Blues had allowed 3.3 goals per game, but scored only 2.77 goals per game, good for 25th and 26th in the league, respectively.\nIn their next 45 games, they allowed 2.18 goals per game, behind only the New York Islanders, and scored 3.16 per game, tied with the Washington Capitals for 10th most in the league. Binnington recorded four more shutouts and led the league in wins, saves percentage and goals-against average after his debut.\n\n\nCode\nfirsthalf &lt;- read_csv(\"NHL2019Jan2.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season = 2019.1, goaldif = GF-GA)\nsecondhalf &lt;- read_csv(\"NHL2019April7.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season = 2019.2, goaldif = GF-GA)\n\ncombined &lt;- bind_rows(firsthalf, secondhalf)\n\nstl &lt;- combined |&gt; filter(Team ==\"St. Louis Blues\")\n\ndifferential &lt;- ggplot()+\n  geom_line(data=combined, aes(x=season, y=goaldif, group=Team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_line(data=stl, aes(x=season, y=goaldif, group=Team,), color=\"#002F87\")+\n  geom_point(data=combined, aes(x=season, y=goaldif, group=Team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=stl, aes(x=season, y=goaldif, group=Team), color=\"#002F87\")+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)+\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.27, y=-7, label=\"Negative\\nGoal Diff.\"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.05, y=7, label=\"Positive\\nGoal Diff.\"), color=\"darkgreen\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.1, y=-52, label=\"Jan. 2\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.2, y=-52, label=\"April 7\"), color=\"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2019.1, 2019.2), limits=c(2019,2019.3))+\n  geom_text(data=stl |&gt; filter(season == max(season)), aes(x=season + .05, y=goaldif+.05, group=Team, label=\"St. Louis\"))+\n  geom_text(data=stl |&gt; filter(season == min(season)), aes(x=season - .05, y=goaldif, group=Team, label=\"St. Louis\"))+\n  labs(\n    x=\" \",\n    y=\"Goal Differential\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title=element_text(size=20, face=\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position=\"plot\",\n    axis.text.x=element_blank(),\n    ) \n\naverage &lt;- ggplot()+\n  geom_line(data=combined, aes(x=season, y=`GA/GP`, group=Team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_line(data=stl, aes(x=season, y=`GA/GP`, group=Team,), color=\"#002F87\")+\n  geom_point(data=combined, aes(x=season, y=`GA/GP`, group=Team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=stl, aes(x=season, y=`GA/GP`, group=Team), color=\"#002F87\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=2.81)+\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.05, y=2.9, label=\"NHL Average\"), color=\"black\")+\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.1, y=1.91, label=\"Jan. 2\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019.2, y=1.91, label=\"April 7\"), color=\"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2019.1, 2019.2), limits=c(2019,2019.3))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(2,3,4), limits=c(1.9,4.1))+\n  geom_text(data=stl |&gt; filter(season == max(season)), aes(x=season + .05, y=`GA/GP`+.05, group=Team, label=\"St. Louis\"))+\n  geom_text(data=stl |&gt; filter(season == min(season)), aes(x=season - .05, y=`GA/GP`, group=Team, label=\"St. Louis\"))+\n  labs(\n    x=\" \",\n    y=\"Goals Against Average\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title=element_text(size=20, face=\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position=\"plot\",\n    axis.text.x=element_blank()\n    ) \n\ndifferential + average +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title=\"A complete 180\",\n    subtitle=\"St. Louis not only increased goals per game, but also decreased goals-against per game after Jan. 2, 2019.\",\n    caption=\"Source: NHLStats.com | By Damon Bennett\"\n  )&\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title=element_text(size=20, face=\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position=\"plot\",\n    axis.text.x=element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a shock to nobody, scoring more goals and allowing opponents to score less goals translates to wins.

In the playoffs, they never played less than six games in a series, and the fireworks continued in the final.\nOn June 12, 2019, St. Louis hoisted the Stanley Cup for the first time ever, after defeating the Boston Bruins 4-1 in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final, becoming the first team in the expansion era (since 1967, the year St. Louis joined the NHL) to win the Stanley Cup after being in last place more than 20 games into the season.\nThat stat sounds weird because it is. Two teams have won the Stanley Cup with losing records, but that was before color TV, and when the NHL was only six teams.\nLate season revivals have happened before in the NHL. The most recent example is the Los Angeles Kings in 2012, who were the 8th overall seed in the Western Conference, and defeated the New York Rangers to claim the cup. The Kings were never in last place in the league, however, and any other dramatic turnaround occurred when hockey sticks were wooden and vital organ protection was optional.\nThe NHL began playing 82 games per season in 1996. When comparing St. Louis to the other 28 champions since, it’s pretty clear just how dismal their first 37 games were.\n\n\nCode\nrankings96oct &lt;- read_csv(\"96 first half.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(season = 1996.1)|&gt;

Yet, 161 days after hitting rock bottom, they hoisted the biggest trophy in sports, after the biggest comeback season of the modern era.\nAfter firing their head coach, picking a fight at practice, and taking a chance on a 25-year-old rookie goaltender, the St. Louis blues mounted one of the greatest comebacks in sports. Should teams look to repeat this combination to replicate their success? Probably not."
